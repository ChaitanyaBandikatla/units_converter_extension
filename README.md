||Docs: what: point descriptions of each class/function (in isolation) ||
||Docs: how: for common use cases X,Y,Z mini-tutorials showing worked examples on how to do X,Y,Z||
||Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing||
||Docs: 3 minute video, posted to YouTube. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.||
|| (hard) code conforms to some known patterns ||

| zero internal boundaries | evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files||
| | evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)||

| | evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base||
| low-regressions rule | (hard to judge) features released are not subsequently removed||
|short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work||
